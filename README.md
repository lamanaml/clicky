# Clicky - a memory game challenge
Challenge yourself to a React Memory game. Click on a food image to start the game.  The images will be reshuffled.  If your next click is a new image, you get a point.  If you forget, and click an image that you have already clicked... You lose the game.
Choose 12 unique images in a row and you win the game!
